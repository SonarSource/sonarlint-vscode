**ALWAYS CONSULT [.sonar-code-context/SONAR.md](.sonar-code-context/SONAR.md) BEFORE GENERATING OR MODIFYING CODE.**

This file contains project-specific SonarQube analysis including guidelines, architecture, and dependencies that must guide all development.

## Development Requirements

**MANDATORY ACTIONS:**
1. **READ** .sonar-code-context/SONAR.md before any development task
2. **FOLLOW** all documented quality rules and standards  
3. **MAINTAIN** architectural consistency per documentation
4. **RESPECT** all dependency constraints documented
5. **VALIDATE** code against documented quality rules

## Guidelines Section
Contains SonarQube rules, coding standards, compliance examples, and severity classifications.

**APPLY** recommended patterns, **AVOID** documented anti-patterns, **PRIORITIZE** fixes by severity.

## Architecture Section  
Documents project structure, component relationships, design patterns, and technology stack.

**PRESERVE** established patterns, **FOLLOW** documented organization.

## Dependencies Section
Lists dependency constraints, version requirements, security considerations, and management practices.
